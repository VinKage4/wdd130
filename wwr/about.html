        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The history of this company started in 2024 when we had our first experience with rafting. It all began as a simple adventure among friends seeking the thrill of navigating wild rivers and discovering the beauty of nature from a new perspective. The exhilaration of conquering the rapids, the teamwork required to stay afloat, and the unforgettable memories forged along the way sparked an idea: to share this incredible experience with others.

            What started as a weekend adventure quickly turned into a passion. We realized that rafting wasn't just about the adrenaline rush‚Äîit was about connecting with nature, building camaraderie, and challenging ourselves. By the end of that year, we decided to turn our passion into a business, offering guided rafting tours for people of all experience levels.
            
            Our mission is to provide safe, exciting, and memorable rafting experiences that allow adventurers to immerse themselves in nature while creating lifelong memories. From serene family-friendly floats to heart-pounding whitewater challenges, our team is dedicated to delivering high-quality experiences with expert guides and top-notch equipment.
            
            Today, we continue to grow and expand our offerings, always staying true to the spirit of adventure that inspired us in the beginning. Join us on the river and become part of our story‚Äîbecause the best adventures are the ones we share together.</p>
